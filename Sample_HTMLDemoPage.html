<h2>WCAG</h2>
<p>It is a set of international standards that help make websites and apps accessible to everyone — especially people with disabilities (like vision, hearing, motor, or cognitive issues).</p>
<h3>WCAG Principles</h3>
<p>WCAG Principles are the 4 main rules that guide how to make websites accessible to people with disabilities.
These principles are known as POUR:</p>
<ol>
<li>Perceivable</li>
<li>Operable</li>
<li>Understandable</li>
<li>Robust</li>
</ol>
<h4>Perceivable</h4>
<p>Perceivable means that all users — including those with visual or hearing disabilities — must be able to see, hear, or feel the content.</p>
<ul>
<li>Text Alternatives</li>
<li>Time-Based Media</li>
<li>Adaptable Content</li>
<li>Distinguishable</li>
</ul>
<h5>Alternative Text Guidelines</h5>
<p>Provide text descriptions for all non-text content like images, audio, video, buttons, icons, and charts — so that screen readers or other assistive tools can explain them.</p>
<h6>Non-text Content</h6>
<p><em>1.1.1 Non-text Content</em><br>
All non-text content must have a text alternative that serves the same purpose.</p>
